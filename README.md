# Dayleez - online Stores Explorer
This project was originally developed as part of my participation in the **3rd edition of the "Trophées Ana Maâk"** competition, an initiative organized by **Attijariwafa Bank** to support innovation and entrepreneurship.  
## Project description
DayLeez is a mobile application designed to help users explore and navigate through various online stores in Morocco. The app aggregates and lists the latest deals from these online stores, providing users with a convenient way to discover new products and promotions. 
The backend of the app utilizes a Python script for web scraping to collect data from different online stores, which is then stored in Firebase. 
The frontend is developed using React Native, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across both iOS and Android platforms.
## Features
- Explore Online Stores: Browse through a comprehensive list of online stores in Morocco.
- Latest Deals: View the most recent deals and promotions from each store.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface (inspired from Instagram UI) built with React Native.
- Real-Time Data: Data is updated in real-time using web scraping and stored in Firebase.
