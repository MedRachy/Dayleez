# Dayleez - online Stores Explorer
### This project was originally developed as part of my participation in the 3rd edition of the "Trophées Ana Maâk" competition, an initiative organized by Attijariwafa Bank to support innovation and entrepreneurship.
DayLeez is a mobile application designed to help users explore and navigate through various online stores in Morocco. The app aggregates and lists the latest deals from these online stores, providing users with a convenient way to discover new products and promotions. 
The backend of the app utilizes a Python script for web scraping to collect data from different online stores, which is then stored in Firebase. 
The frontend is developed using React Native, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across both iOS and Android platforms.
## Features
- Explore Online Stores: Browse through a comprehensive list of online stores in Morocco.
- Latest Deals: View the most recent deals and promotions from each store.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface (inspired from Instagram UI) built with React Native.
- Real-Time Data: Data is updated in real-time using web scraping and stored in Firebase.
